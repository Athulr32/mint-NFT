A simple NFT minting website 

You can deploy the contract and paste the ABI and the contract address to mint in a new smart contract

In server I have used pinnata to easily upload files to IPFS
1) Create account in pinnata
2) Get the API keys
3) Paste it in the server side code by creating a .env file
